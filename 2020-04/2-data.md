# Data

For each test case, I recorded the following (check out [data.md](04-2020/data.md) for more details):

- In what language or voice the screen reader announces the type of content (screen readers tell you if the content is a heading, an image, etc.)
- In what voice the screen reader announces text content itself.

## VoiceOver (mobile)

### VoiceOver (mobile) + Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera Touch, Edge

On iPhone, you can perform a simple gesture (by default, swipe up with one finger) to change VoiceOver language regardless of the OS language. If VoiceOver is in Finnish, everything is announced with a Finnish voice. When VoiceOver is in English, everything is announced with an English voice.

Note: when the word "image" is at the end of the `alt` text, the screen reader automatically removes it from the description. Same for when the word "button" is at the end of the button text content.
