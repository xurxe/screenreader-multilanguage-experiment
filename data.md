## iPhone + VoiceOver

- Device: iPhone 11
- iOS version: 13.3

### iPhone + VoiceOver + Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera Touch, Edge

- Safari version: 13.0
- Chrome version: 79.0.3945.73
- Firefox version: 20.2 (16690)
- Opera Touch version: 2.0.4
- Edge version: 44.10.13

On iPhone, you can perform a simple gesture (by default, swipe up with one finger) to change VoiceOver language regardless of the OS language. When VoiceOver was in Finnish, everything was ready with a Finnish voice. When VoiceOver was in English, everything was read with an English voice.

Note: when the word "image" is at the end of the `alt` text, the screen reader automatically removes it from the description. Same for when the word "button" is at the end of the button text content.
