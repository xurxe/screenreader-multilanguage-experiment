# Screen reader multilanguage experiment

Just a little experiment on how screen readers handle working in multiple languages on the web (for example, when the OS or screen reader UI is in one language, but the website is in another).

I noticed there were some weird buggy behavior when working in multiple languages, so I decided to a more systematic study!

## Basic

I made a website with a number of common HTML elements.

Then I performed tests...

...using 4 major screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS, TalkBack)

...on 5 major browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera / Opera Touch, Edge)

...on desktop and mobile

...in 2 modes (continous reading, and using keyboard or swiping shortcuts to move the reading cursor)

## Results
